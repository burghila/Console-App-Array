# Console Application for Array and List Management

## Description

This console application demonstrates basic operations with arrays and lists in C#. It allows the user to interact with a one-dimensional string array, a one-dimensional integer array, and a list of strings. The application guides the user to select an index and displays the corresponding value from the selected data structure.

## Features

- **String Array Interaction**: Users can select an index to retrieve a string from a predefined array.
- **Integer Array Interaction**: Users can select an index to retrieve an integer from a predefined array.
- **List Interaction**: Users can select an index to retrieve a string from a predefined list.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes error handling to manage out-of-range index selections.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone [URL of the Repository]`
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: `cd [Project Directory Name]`
3. **Compile the Application**: `csc Program.cs`
4. **Run the Executable**: `./Program`

## Usage

- Run the application as described above.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to select indices from the array or list.
- Input should be integer values within the range of the array or list size.

## Error Handling

If you enter an index that is out of the array or list bounds, the application will display an error message: "Error: Index does not exist."

## About

This project is created as part of a coding assignment to demonstrate handling of arrays and lists in C#.
